    }

Small retina display images are fucking huge.

###Example With Curl

    ⚡ curl https://github.com/igorgue.json | pjson

###Install

Install `pygments`:

    pip install pygments

or, if you run as root:

    sudo pip install pygments

And copy and paste this:

    curl https://raw.github.com/tangsty/pjson/master/pjson > ~/bin/pjson && chmod +x ~/bin/pjson

If it doesn't work run this:

    ⚡ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

For zsh bros, though, they might already know this:

    ⚡ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
